-control legs with arrow keys:
    >order is left arrow, up arrow, right arrow, down arrow
    >have to press keys in above order, and the faster keys pressed, the faster the player goes
    >messing up the sequence by not pressing them in the correct order, or by pressing a different key makes the player stumble
-control arms with a and d:
    >similar to legs in having to get sequence correct
-legs + arms:
    >have to simulataneously match arm sequence with leg sequence, otherwise causes negative effect stated above in legs control
-make keys rebindable
-stumbling:
    >when mistake made with pressing keys, the player will stumble(animation), which basically just slows the player down, 
        but also resets the sequence
    >if user tries to run again by pressing any keys in the legs or arms controls sequences, it will cause the player to stumble again
    >when stumbling a certain number of times in a short enough time, the player will fall over and it will take a bit of time
        to recover and get back up(done automatically)
-note about scope:
    >this game should be quit simple and small(in terms of content)
    >make sure to keep scope small
